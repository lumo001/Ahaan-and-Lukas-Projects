# Ahaan and Lukas - Exam Projects Repository

Welcome to our GitHub repository! This repository contains our exam projects for the following advanced topics that we completed as part of our Bachelor's degree in Data Science at Høyskolen Kristiania:

## Contents

1. **Advanced Programming**
   - Projects and assignments covering concepts such as object-oriented programming, functional programming, and advanced software engineering practices. These projects illustrate our skills in writing efficient, clean, and scalable code.

2. **Data Structures and Algorithms**
   - Implementations and analysis of fundamental data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming). We also include solutions to complex problems that demonstrate our understanding of algorithmic efficiency and optimization.

3. **Machine Learning**
   - Our work in this section includes a variety of machine learning techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and natural language processing. These projects use popular libraries like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Pandas to build and evaluate models on real-world datasets.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured into three main folders:

- `Advanced_Programming/`
- `Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/`
- `Machine_Learning_Exam/`

Each folder contains the relevant notebooks, code files, and documentation for the projects under that topic. We have also included some explanatory README files within each folder for easier navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language used across all projects.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For creating and sharing our work, especially in Machine Learning.
- **Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **PostgreSQL**: For some projects involving database interaction.
- **Git**: Version control for tracking project development.

## How to Use This Repository
Feel free to explore the individual projects to get an understanding of the various concepts we have worked on. Each folder contains a README with details on how to run the code and the dependencies required.
